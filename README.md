*Online Quiz App Code Explanation*

This Java code is for a simple console-based quiz application. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1.  A `Question` class is defined to hold the question text, options, and correct answer.
2.  A list of `Question` objects is created, containing multiple questions with options and correct answers.
3.  The application iterates through each question, displays the options, and asks the user for their answer.
4.  The user's answer is validated against the correct answer, and feedback is provided accordingly.
5.  After all questions have been answered, the application displays the final score.

*Key Features:*

- *Console-Based Interface*: The application uses a simple console-based interface for user interaction.
- *Multiple Questions*: The application supports multiple questions with options and correct answers.
- *Score Tracking*: The application tracks the user's score and provides feedback on correct and incorrect answers.
